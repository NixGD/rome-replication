# rome-replication

A replication of the paper Moving the Eiffel Tower to ROME: Tracing and Editing Facts in GPT.

Completed as part of MLAB, run by Redwood Research. Some files adapted from the MLAB ciriculum or co-written with other participants.

This project was a collaboration between Nicholas Goldowsky-Dill and Tim Bauman. Special thanks to Neel Nanda for ideas & advice, and for the (currently anonymous) authors of the replicated paper.
